# Architecture: Screaming (feature-first + Scope Rule)

## Quick ref
**Intent:** Top-level folders announce the business domain (inbox, contacts, billing), not the framework (components, services, controllers).
**Dependency rule:** `features/*` may import `shared/` and `core/`; `shared/` imports neither features nor core components; `core/` imports no features; no feature imports another feature.
**Detect:** `src/app/features/` or `src/features/` (Angular/React), `src/modules/<domain>/` (NestJS), `app/domains/` or namespaced `app/models/<domain>/` (Rails).
**Scope Rule:** used by one feature only -> inside that feature; reused by 2+ features -> `shared/`; cross-cutting infrastructure (auth, http, realtime, config) -> `core/`.

## Layout
```
src/app/
  core/            infrastructure only: interceptors, auth, realtime, app config, layout shell
  shared/          reusable by 2+ features: ui components, pipes, directives, pure utils, shared models
  features/
    <feature>/     named after the domain (inbox, contacts, billing)
      components/  dumb/presentational pieces of this feature
      pages/       routed containers (or at feature root)
      services/    state + data access for this feature
      entities/    (or models/) types and mappers of this feature
      <feature>.routes.ts   lazy route subtree
  app.routes.ts    loadChildren -> features/<feature>/<feature>.routes
```
Mappings:
- **Angular 21:** standalone only (no NgModule), signals, OnPush, `loadChildren: () => import('./features/inbox/inbox.routes')`. Aliases `@core/*`, `@features/*`, `@shared/*`.
- **React/Next:** `src/features/<feature>/{components,hooks,api,types}`, `src/shared/`, `src/core/` (or `lib/`). Next: `app/<route>` stays thin and imports from `features/<feature>` public entry.
- **NestJS:** one module per domain: `src/modules/<domain>/{<domain>.module,controller,service,dto,entities}`; cross-cutting in `src/common/` or `src/core/` (guards, filters, interceptors, config). Domain modules talk via exported services, never via another module's repository.
- **Rails:** `app/domains/<domain>/{models,services,controllers,serializers}` (or namespaces/engines per domain: `app/models/billing/invoice.rb`, `Billing::InvoiceService`); cross-cutting in `lib/` or `app/lib/`.

## Dependency rules
| From | May import | Must not import |
|---|---|---|
| `features/<a>` | own files, `shared/`, `core/` | `features/<b>` (any other feature) |
| `shared/` | `shared/`, third-party libs | `features/`, `core/` services |
| `core/` | `core/`, third-party libs, `shared/` pure utils | `features/`, `shared/components` |
| `app.routes.ts` | lazy `import()` of feature routes | static imports of feature components |

If two features need the same contract, move it to `shared/` (type/interface) or communicate through an event/store in `core/`.

## Placement rules
1. Used by exactly one feature? -> inside that feature, even if it looks generic. Do not pre-emptively share.
2. A second feature now needs it? -> move it to `shared/` in the same change and update both consumers.
3. Is it infrastructure (http interceptor, auth session, websocket client, app config, error handler)? -> `core/`.
4. Is it a new business capability? -> new `features/<domain-name>/` with its own `*.routes.ts`, registered with `loadChildren`.
5. Generic folder names (`utils/`, `helpers/`, `common/`, `misc/`) at feature level are forbidden; name by what it does in the domain (`conversation-filters.ts`).
6. A generic util with no domain meaning that two features use -> `shared/utils/<specific-name>.ts`, never `core/`.

## Conformance checklist
Replace `<feature>` with the feature being edited.

- [ ] No feature imports another feature — check: `grep -rnP "from '(@features/|(\.\./)+features/)(?!<feature>)" src/app/features/<feature>` returns nothing.
- [ ] `shared/` does not import features — check: `grep -rnE "features/|@features/" src/app/shared` returns nothing.
- [ ] `core/` does not import features or shared components — check: `grep -rnE "features/|@features/|shared/components|@shared/components" src/app/core` returns nothing.
- [ ] Features are lazy — check: `grep -nE "loadChildren|loadComponent" src/app/app.routes.ts` lists the feature; `grep -nE "^import .*features/" src/app/app.routes.ts` returns nothing.
- [ ] No NgModule introduced — check: `grep -rn "@NgModule" src/app` returns nothing (or only documented justifications).
- [ ] No generic folders inside the feature — check: `find src/app/features/<feature> -type d \( -name utils -o -name helpers -o -name common -o -name misc \)` returns nothing.
- [ ] New shared code has 2+ consumers — check: `grep -rln "<SharedSymbol>" src/app/features` lists at least 2 features.
- [ ] Routes file exists and is named after the domain — check: `ls src/app/features/<feature>/<feature>.routes.ts`.
- [ ] Functions <= 30 lines, components <= 300 lines — check: `wc -l` on touched component files.
- [ ] No `any`, no dead or commented-out code in touched files — check: `grep -rnE ":\s*any\b|as any" <touched files>` returns nothing.
- [ ] Names reveal the domain (`ConversationListComponent`, not `ListComponent`/`Manager`/`Helper`) — review touched file names.

## Clean Code expectations
- One responsibility per file; a feature service owns that feature's state only.
- Pages orchestrate, components render, services hold state and I/O; no HTTP in components.
- Prefer small, intention-revealing functions; name by domain language, not technical role.
- Refactor to share only after the second real use (rule of three tolerance: two is enough to move to `shared/`).

## Common violations -> fix
| Violation | Fix |
|---|---|
| `features/inbox` imports `features/contacts/contact.service` | Extract the contract to `shared/` (type) or expose data via a `core/` store/event |
| Component used by one feature lives in `shared/` | Move it into the feature (Scope Rule) |
| `core/` holds a generic `StringUtils` | Move to `shared/utils/` under a specific name |
| `shared/` component injects a feature service | Pass data via `input()`/`output()`; feature container injects the service |
| Feature route statically imported in `app.routes.ts` | Use `loadChildren: () => import('./features/<f>/<f>.routes')` |
| Folder `components/` at app root holding domain pieces | Move into the owning feature |
| NestJS service injects another module's repository | Import that module and use its exported service |

## Enforcement tooling
- Angular/React/TS: `eslint-plugin-boundaries` or `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`; `dependency-cruiser` rules forbidding `features/a -> features/b`; `eslint no-restricted-imports` as a minimal option.
- NestJS: same TS tools; Rails: `packwerk` (when domains are packs) or Zeitwerk namespaces plus RuboCop custom cops.
