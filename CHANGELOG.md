# Changelog

The installed version is in `<skills-dir>/waymark/VERSION`. When a newer version is published the agent offers the update; you can also say *"actualiza Waymark desde https://github.com/LiriRaid/waymark siguiendo su INSTALL.md"* (INSTALL §9).

## 1.2.0 — lessons from the second real test
The second test confirmed 1.1.0 (routing line first, department skill as the first tool call, Spanish narration, build gate, reuse found, right result first try). Remaining gaps:
- **Environment knowledge:** `profile.md` gets an *Environment* section (OS, shell, missing tools, how to edit files), read at Recall and filled by the learning loop, so no session wastes attempts (e.g. heredoc → missing python → Edit).
- **Verifiable memory step:** the brief states `Memoria: leída | creada <file>` before the first edit.
- **Announced skills are invoked** with the skill tool; no announcing skills that are not used.
- **No unrequested behavior:** extras are proposed, not implemented.
- **Gates after the last edit;** L2 without a spec: add one where the project tests that kind of file, else say "sin infraestructura de test" and give a one-line check.
- `dept-frontend` Quick ref lists the key UX musts.

## 1.1.0 — lessons from the first real test
The first real test fixed in one attempt a bug that had failed over 20 times, but the agent skipped the "expensive" parts of the routine on a quick fix. This release makes them cheap and concrete:
- **First actions are explicit:** first text is the routing line, first tool call is the owner `dept-*` skill; all text in the user's language (block and hook).
- **Minimal bootstrap:** a missing project memory is created in one step (identity + gates from the project's own docs or manifest); the full scan is for L2+.
- **L1 minimum gate:** lint or typecheck of the changed files (UI: quickest compile check).
- **Evidence plan B:** without a browser or behind a login, give the user a one-line DevTools/console check and mark the fix *no verificado*.
- **Learn always:** a missing memory file is no reason to skip *Work in progress* and *Solved problems*.
- **Quick bug triage** procedure in `dept-qa`.
- Instructions block rewritten shorter.

## 1.0.0 — first release as Waymark
- **Departments:** 10 department skills (`dept-product`, `dept-architecture`, `dept-frontend`, `dept-ux-ui`, `dept-backend`, `dept-data`, `dept-security`, `dept-qa`, `dept-devops`, `dept-devex`) plus the `waymark` core and 6 tool skills (`ui-build`, `ui-refine`, `ui-system`, `ui-audit`, `browser-verify`, `library-docs`).
- **Rule 0 on every request:** recall → route → skills → verify → learn; questions in read-only consult mode; routing line at the start of every reply; per-prompt reminder hook.
- **Layered loading:** instructions block → one department → one procedure → one mode; references only when needed.
- **Right decision, faster:** reuse before create, minimal project scan with a project map, evidence before change, two-strike rule, official docs escalation, *Solved problems* with dead ends.
- **Self-filling memory** in `~/.waymark/`, shared by every agent, with *Work in progress* so another session or agent resumes where the last stopped.
- **Grows with use:** missing skills are created (global or project, asked), unknown architectures get a generated profile, the user's own MCP servers are mapped and used.
- **Install, update and uninstall** written for the agent (INSTALL.md), multi-agent, with choice windows, backups and daily update notices.
